# Quantum AI Enabled Search Engine

This project is the **backend prototype** for a custom search engine.  
It provides REST APIs for crawling web pages, indexing their content using **Apache Lucene**, and retrieving ranked search results.  
The goal is to build a foundation similar to a classical search engine, ready for future integration with **LLM** and **Quantum-AI-based** modules.

## ðŸš€ Features
- **Crawling API** â€“ fetches and indexes pages from a given seed URL
- **Lucene-based indexing and BM25 retrieval** â€“ stores title, URL, and body snippet
- **REST Search API** â€“ simple `/api/search?q=...` interface for frontend clients
- **Pagination support** â€“ `page` and `size` parameters
- **Configurable index path** â€“ via `app.index.path` in `application.properties`
- **Work in progress** â€“ hooks for LLM-based query rewriting and Quantum AI -inspired ranking (planned for Step 2)
